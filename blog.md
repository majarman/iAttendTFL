## Birth of a Blog!
### 02/08/2020
Thank you for your interest in our development of the iAttend project! This page will be dedicated to blog posts concerning the development progress of the project. There will be a weekly post live every Monday describing the progress that is being made, along with any news or changes.

So far, the TFL team has made significant progress in nailing down the requirements and specifications of the document. Draft ii of the Software Requirements Specification document describes this work. The team has also settled on a few design elements, including:

- Use of the Azure cloud to host the server, along with the built in Kestrel web server,
- PostgreSQL as the database,
- ASP.NET as the server side scripting language,
- Visual Studio as the IDE, with built in support for the .NET frameworks,
- Xamarin as the cross-platform mobile development framework,
- GitHub as the sole project management and central code repository,
- and GitHub pages as our project website.

The TFL team looks forward to making significant progress in the coming weeks getting the infrastructure set up and configured. More news on development is coming soon, along with a timetable for features to be released. Stay tuned!
